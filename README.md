# XGBoostPredictBTC
I use XGBoost Classifier to predict the trends of Bitcoin using bitcoin historical data.
Using Classifier to predict the trends instead of predict the actual price of bitcoin because predict actual price need more data and it need more data to 
train the model, but by predict the trends start, end and the turn of trends also can get the same output we want.
But the disadvantages of this model is it is too easy to get overfitting make it predict the test.csv data get 100% accuracy. 
The more important is the concept of cleaning and processing the BTC data.
